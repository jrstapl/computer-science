# Transcript
This transcript contains the completed courses towards satisfaction of the [outlined requirements](/CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md) for the open source computer science degree. Not all courses are a 1-to-1 mapping of the [suggested courses](/README.md#curriculum), as most are a result of my own exploration. Instead, this transcript is designed to provide an accurate list of completed online courses covering various topics in programming and computer science, as well as relevant courses completed during my undergraduate (Clemon University, B.S., Bioengineering) and graduate (Wake Forest University School of Medicine, M.S., Ph.D (in progress), Biomedical Engineering) education. University courses are indicated by course number as appears in my school transcript (with credit hours instead of total hours), online courses are included with a link to the website for further inquiries regarding the content. Programming languages relevant to a given course are additionally listed at the end of the table, otherwise, if no languages were used and/or relevant, this column is listed as `NA`. 

# Organization
The organization of this document follows the same format as the outlined [curriculum](/README.md#curriculum)

# Core 
The core classes are meant to cover basic computer science theory and practical application through the use of programming languages, and common problem solving and design pattern techniques.

# Advanced CS
Courses in the advanced category are meant to promote specialization of a particular topic. As this section is meant to be the `electives` of a traditional degree, the mapping of courses here is somewhat loose, as I have deviated from the original intent to organize my courses into the pre-defined [categories](/README.md#curriculum). Courses here tend to focus on compound concepts that incorporate multiple languages or technologies (e.g. databases, full-stack development, testing, version control, etc.).

# Capstone Projects
The "Capstone Projects" are projects that I've designed to solve some issue, typically something that I've noticed a use for in my particular field of research. My topics of interest are command line tools and graphical applications to be used in support of answering research questions effeciently and reproducibly. These projects are meant to showcase my learnings of various languages, concepts in computer science and application of core prinicples to real-world problems.
